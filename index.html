                    <p class="tagline"> Last May, I graduated with a Master's in Biomedical Engineering (BME) from University of Michigan - Ann Arbor. <br><br>
                        My degree concentrated in biotechnology, and I have since been working as a Research Assistant in <a href="https://moonlab.engin.umich.edu/">the Moon Lab</a>, 
                        developing immunomodulatory theraputics for autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases. I'm also interested in the gut-brain axis, pathologic effects of gut microbiome dysbiosis, 
                        genetic engineering and synthetic biology. <br><br>
                        I'm moved by the notion of inequality when it comes to personal health and inequity regarding access to healthcare - the idea that an individual has no choice over the body 
                        they are given and just as little control over the resources they are born to. The desire to counteract these imbalances stemming from nature and chance is what drives me to work 
                        towards the personal goal of enabling more people to live their life to the fullest.
                        <br><br>
                        Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in BME at UMich and *found my lost soul* traveling on the weekends around SEA during an exchange semester at NUS in Singapore.
                        <br><br>
                        I also love connecting with people, foreign languages, board games, ice cream, natural light, and listening to the Huberman Lab podcast when I mealprep :D

                            <p>The first ever biotech class I took involved writing a mock Small Business Investigational Research (SBIR) proposal. In my literature review, I focused on optimizing lipid nanoparticles for specific cargo delivery to CD4+ T cells, including choice of LNP components as well as efficacy testing and potential pitfalls + alterantive approaches.</p>

                            <p>For my BME most heavily electrical engineering themed course, my team focused on addressing the hardships of life experienced by people with anosmia - a condition that causes one to lose sense of smell. This leaves the suffering individuals vulnerable to potential dangers such as gas leaks and fires. I prototyped a wearable gas-detecting controlled system of electronics (including a MQ2 gas sensor, an LED diode, a vibration motor and a speaker), using C++ to code an Arduino board.

                            <p>For my senior design project, worked in a team to ideate a non-invasive glucose monitoring device using NIR light to improve patient compliance. Developed a regression model from manual glucose measurements and the PPG signal - obtained using prototyped breadboard circuitry and processed in LabVIEW - to get the readout. This coursework project was very much going through a product design pipeline with stakeholder interviews, scoping out user needs, and formulating design requirements and specifications, but only prototyping specific parts of the device for user testing by the end of the semester.</p>

                            <p>Wanted to try out consulting; ended up taking a client-based course, and got matched with the UofM School of Nursing with the goal to bring a product to support

                                Conducted stakeholder interviews and led a team to create a marketing

                            <p>I care about women’s health and equitable access to health care. As an undergrad, I joined M-HEAL (Michigan Health Engineered For All Lives) and became a part of Project MIA. Partnered with an indigenous community of Kashibo Cocha in Peru, we aimed to provide them with a DYI sustainable menstrual pad with locally-sourced banana fiber insert to allow the girls and women to participate in their daily lives without any constraints. Working on the design team, I proposed iterations of the pad prototype, learned to sew, and carried out mesh layer testing.</p>

                            <p>I’m big on giving back and community building. I made some of my first friends in college through mentorship program email exchanges before coming to campus. Subsequently, for 2 years in college, I was on the board and later ran a student organization aiming to make incoming international students feel more prepared for life at UMich. It took a lot of match-making and organization, and I like to think that some of the friendships formed as part of the program survived until now.</p>

                            <p>In COVID, I launched and organized an online FB series of facilitated guest speaker lectures on physics to make science concepts not usually taught in school more accessible to teens and adults alike. The <a href="">most-watched lecture</a> with <a href="">Andrzej Dragan</a> came at over 8.4k views.</p>
