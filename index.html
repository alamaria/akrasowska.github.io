                    <p class="tagline"> I recently graduated with a Master's in Biomedical Engineering (BME) from University of Michigan - Ann Arbor.<br><br>
                        My degree concentrated in biotechnology and I have since been working as a Research Assistant in <a href="https://moonlab.engin.umich.edu/">the Moon Lab</a>, developing immunomodulatory theraputics for autoimmune and neurodegenerative diseases.<br><br>
                        Previously, I completed my Bachelor's in BME at UMich and found my lost soul traveling on the weekends around SEA during an exchange semester at NUS in Singapore.<br><br>
                        I love board games, natural light, and listening to the Huberman Lab podcast when I mealprep :D
